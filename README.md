This is my entry for the [A Game By Its Cover 2017 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2017),
and inspired by the [Famicase entry by Tek-Man (Patrick Gordon)](http://famicase.com/17/softs/052.html).

This is a top down shooter with tank based movement that is basically a single
boss battle. Very simple.

Just a final note, due to the development history the source code for this game
is an absolute mess, I don't plan to clean it up (or continue development in
general). You've been warned ;)

Third Party Assets

This game uses a few 3rd party assets without which I would never have
completely this project.
